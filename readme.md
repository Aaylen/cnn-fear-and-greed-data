This program can be used for backtesting purpopses or for scraping CNN's Fear and Greed index

From scraping:
+ This website has all of the CNN's historical data, so I scraped from them
    + https://www.finhacker.cz/fear-and-greed-index-historical-data-and-chart/
+ Just import the function how you normally would
    + from scrapeCNNData import fetch_fear_greed_data
+ This data has is not continuos, but they have around 4 or 5 data points per month going back to 2011

For backtesting:
+ The way I have it set up is you get an investing budget per week and then you 
can choose how much of the budget to spend per week depending on the fear/greed index.
If you spend less you can spend more the next weekm but either way DCA or active management will both have the ability to invest the same amount.
+ Quick spoiler I tried finding the optimal combination which you can see in the results.txt, but it's not worth it to out perform DCA at least on the SPY.
